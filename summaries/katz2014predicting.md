### Intro

Every year thousands of petitioners appeal to have their case considered by the United States Supreme Court. In most situations, the Court will decide to hear a case by granting a petition for a writ of certiorari. If that petition is granted, each of the parties to the litigation will then submit written materials on the relevant issues and later provide oral argument before the Court. Based upon the weight of the arguments before the Court and other factors, each participating justice (typically nine) ultimately cast his or her vote whether to affirm or reverse the decision of the lower court. From a prediction standpoint, there are two related but distinct prediction questions:
  (1) Will the Court affirm or reverse the lower Court’s judgment?
  (2) How will each individual Justice vote on the question before him or her? 
As these are typically questions considered in both academic and popular circles, these are the questions we seek to predict.


### Contributions

- They constructed a model designed to predict the voting behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States using the extremely randomized tree method.
- Using only data available prior to the date of decision, our model correctly identifies 69.7% of the Court’s overall affirm / reverse decisions and correctly forecasts 70.9% of the votes of individual justices

### Conclusions
