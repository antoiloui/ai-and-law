### Intro

Every year thousands of petitioners appeal to have their case considered by the United States Supreme Court. In most situations, the Court will decide to hear a case by granting a petition for a writ of certiorari. If that petition is granted, each of the parties to the litigation will then submit written materials on the relevant issues and later provide oral argument before the Court. Based upon the weight of the arguments before the Court and other factors, each participating justice (typically nine) ultimately cast his or her vote whether to affirm or reverse the decision of the lower court. From a prediction standpoint, there are two related but distinct prediction questions:  
  1. Will the Court affirm or reverse the lower Court’s judgment?  
  2. How will each individual Justice vote on the question before him or her?  
As these are typically questions considered in both academic and popular circles, these are the questions we seek to predict.


### Contributions

- They constructed a model designed to predict the voting behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States using the extremely randomized tree method.
- There are two forms of prediction in this study:  
  - justice level vote prediction;
  - the prediction of the overall case outcome. 
- Applying the extremely randomized trees approach to each case from 1953-2013, their model correctly forecasts 69.7% of Case Outcomes and 70.9% of Justice Level Vote Outcomes over the sixty year period.


### Conclusions

- Using only information known prior to the Court’s decision, case by case and term by term, they construct a model that predicts each decision of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1953 - 2013.
