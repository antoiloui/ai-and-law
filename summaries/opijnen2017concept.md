### Intro

- The concept of ‘relevance’ is crucial to legal information retrieval, but because of its intuitive understanding it goes undefined too easily and unexplored too often.


### Contributions

- They discuss a conceptual framework on relevance within legal information retrieval, based on a typology of relevance dimensions used within general information retrieval science, but tailored to the specific features of legal information.
- This framework can be used for the development and improvement of legal information retrieval systems.

### Conclusions

- Relevance, the basic notion of information retrieval is a thoroughly human notion and as all human notions, it is somewhat messy.
- Relevance within legal information retrieval deserves specific attention, due to rapidly growing repositories, the distinct features of legal information objects and the complicated tasks of legal professionals.
- Because most LIR systems are designed by retrieval specialists without comprehensive domain knowledge, sometimes assisted by domain specialists with too little knowledge of retrieval technology, users are often disappointed by their relevance performance.
- 4 main conclusions:
  - First of all, retrieval engineering is focused too exclusively on algorithmic relevance, but it has been proven sufficiently that without domain specific adaptations every search engine will disappoint legal users. All dimensions of relevance have to be considered explicitly while designing all components of LIR systems: document pre-processing, (meta)data modelling, query building, retrieval engine and user interface.
  - Secondly, the ‘isness’ concept is overlooked too often. Finding (the expressions of) a work is—and not (just) the related works—is an often-used functionality for jurists, but misunderstood by system developers.
  - Thirdly, also domain relevance is an underdeveloped concept. While there is a tendency to publish ever more legal information, especially court decisions, without tagging it as to its juristic value, information overkill will become a serious threat to the accessibility of such databases. Performance on other relevance dimensions will suffer if the problem of domain relevance isn’t tackled sufficiently.
  - Finally, the gap between LIR systems and user needs is still substantial. For a full understanding of their search needs just taking stock of their wishes is not going to suffice, since legal professionals are not capable of describing the features of a system that does not yet exist. To understandthe juristic mindset, it is of the utmost importance to follow meticulously their dayto- day retrieval quests. It will for sure reveal interesting insights that can be used to improve the relevance performance of LIR systems.
