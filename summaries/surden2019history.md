## Artificial Intelligence and Law â€“ An Overview and History

#### AI Approaches

- 2 major AI approaches: **Logic and Rules-based (KR) Approach** and **Machine Learning (Pattern-based approach)**.
- Logic and Rules-Based Approach: Modeling real world processes or systems using *logical* rules. Then computers can reason about thoses rules. Once you have laws represented in computer processable form, you can engage in computer deductive reasoning that is basically difficult or impossible for humans to do on your own (e.g., TurboTax: expert system in tax liability).
- Don't have to choose one or the other approach: many successful AI systems are hybrids.

#### Categories of AI and Law use

- **Administrators of Law**: those who create and apply the law (judges, legislators, regulators, etc)
  - Judges: we see judges starting to rely on sentencing and bail reports produced primarily by a machine learning algorithm that gives risk of reoffending and the judges are not bound by these reports but often they follow them.
  - Government Officials: in governement benefits decision, legal officials are using this to make decisions about whether somebody qualifies to get a certain benefit or not.
  - Police: predictive policing for likely crime areas and facial recognition for suspects.
  
- **Practitioners of Law**: attorney and others interpreting or advocating in legal system.
  - Litigation e-discovery and Technology assisted review: Use of machine learning algorithms in technology assisted document review which are better and faster at detecting documents that are likely to be relevant or privileged to litigation.
  - Legal analytics: trying to predict how a judge might rule on a particular case or how a venue might  treat a favorable case based upon past outcomes.
  - Case outcome prediction: some hedge funds are trying to use various predictive algorithms to try and bet on litigation finance.
  - Legal document creation and assembly: automated patent writing, automated contract assembly.
  - Automated documument analysis and diligence: machine learning algorithm for finding relavant documents and information through thousands of documents.
  - Natural language processing of legal documents.`
  - Computable contracts.
  - Legal research.
  - Law firm management.
  
- **"Users" of Law**: ordinary individuals or business that have to comply with law.
  - Businesses:
    - Regulatory compliance engines: interest in using ML and rulew engines for complying (e.g., with GDPR).
    - Computable contracts
    - Expert systems
    - Computable policies and mbedded law
    - Automated dispute resolution
    - Automated legeal document analysis
  - Ordinary people:
    - Legal expert systems: e.g., TurboTax
    - Legal chatbots and automated legal self-help: e.g., DoNotPay
    - Automated legal document assembly
