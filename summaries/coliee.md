## The Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE)

### Tasks description

- **Task 1 - The Legal Case Retrieval Task**: This task consists in finding which cases, in the set of candidate cases, should be "noticed" with respect to a given query case.
- **Task 2 - The Legal Case Entailment task**: Given a base case and an extracted specific fragment together with a second case that is relevant in respect to the base case, this task consists in determining which paragraphs of the second case entail that fragment of the base case.
- **Task 3 - The Statute Law Retrieval Task**: This task involves reading a legal bar exam question Q, and identifying of a subset of Japanese Civil Code Articles S1, S2,..., Sn from the entire Civil Code which are those appropriate for answering the question.
- **Task 4 - The Legal Question Answering Task**: Given a question Q, we have to retrieve relevant articles S1, S2, ..., Sn through phase one, and then we have to determine if the relevant articles entail "Q" or "not Q". The answer of this track is binary: "YES"("Q") or "NO"("not Q").
