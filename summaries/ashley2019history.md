## A Brief History of the Changing Roles of Case Prediction in AI and Law

Tags: `history`

### Intro

Predicting case outcomes has long played a role in research on Artificial Intelligence and Law.

## Contributions

- This article provides a short history of AI and Law research on predicting case outcomes. 

- It then focuses on recent developments in legal text analytics, which employs natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and other computational techniques automatically to extract meanings (or semantics) from archives of legal case decisions, contracts, or statutes.

## Key points

- Building computational models that reason with legal rules, argue with legal cases and precedents, predict legal outcomes, and explain those predictions required addressing the following core questions:
  1. **What legal domain to model?**: determine which areas of the law and problems of interest are to be modeled and what is the use case to which the model will be applied.
