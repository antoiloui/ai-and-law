## Legal Reasoning & Basic Concepts

#### 1. Lawyer toolbox
- As lawyers, we want to *analyze* legal positions and *understand* them.
- It's important to understand the building blocks independently of the labels put on the concepts as those vary from authors, countries, etc.

#### 2. Obligation
- 2 uses:
  - Narrow sense: counterpart of a claim.
  - Broad sense: combination of claim + narrow obligation.
  
#### 3. Claims
- Claim that someone do something.
- You have the competence to *enforce*, *transfer* and *undo* your claim.
