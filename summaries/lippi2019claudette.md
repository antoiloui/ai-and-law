### Intro

- Consumers rarely read the contracts they are required to accept. The biggest lie on the Internet is “I have read and agree to the terms and conditions”. Virtually every app we install and website we browse have their own Terms of Service (ToS), i.e. contracts governing the relation between providers and users, establishing mutual rights and obligations. However, we are not necessarily aware of what we just agreed upon.
- There are reasons why many consumers do not read or understand ToS, as well as privacy policies or end-user license agreements (EULA). Such documents can be overwhelming to the few consumers who actually venture to read them. Another problem is that even if consumers did read the ToS thoroughly, they would have no means to influence their content: the choice is to either agree to the terms offered by a web app or simply not use the service at all.
- European consumer law aims to prevent businesses from using so-called “unfair contractual terms” in contracts they unilaterally draft and require consumers to accept. According to the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (UCTD), a “term” or “clause” (i.e., a sentence, statement on or paragraph expressing a contractual norm that specifies parties rights and obligations) is unfair if, “contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer”.
- Law regarding such terms applies also to the ToS of on-line platforms. In spite of it all, such platforms’ owners do use in their ToS unfair contractual clauses notwithstanding European law, and regardless of consumer protection agencies, which have the competence, but not necessarily the resources, to fight against such unlawful practices.


### Contributions

- They propose a machine learning-based method and tool for partially automating the detection of potentially unfair clauses (contractual provisions).
- In particular, they offer a sentence classification system able to detect full sentences, or paragraphs containing potentially unlawful clauses.
- Such a tool could improve consumers’ understanding of what they agree upon by accepting a contract, as well as serve consumer protection organizations and agencies, by making their work more effective and efficient, by helping them scan and monitor a large number of documents automatically.

### Unfair contractual terms

- According to Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if:
  (1) it has not been individually negotiated; and
  (2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.
